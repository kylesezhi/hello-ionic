About This Guide

We will be making an iOS mobile application with Ionic 1 that accesses a RESTful API. Because this is an iOS application, you'll need to be on MacOS to develop and test.

We will be making an Ionic 1 application, not Ionic 2, so be aware of that when you are Googling for answers. Ionic 2 is quite different than Ionic 1.

Learn Angular

Yes, this is a guide for building an iOS mobile app using Ionic and a RESTful API, so why would you need to learn AngularJS? 

Ionic is built atop Angular so you will need to understand its basics to make anything that works in Ionic. Before we begin, <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js">learn the basics of Angular 1 here free.</a>

All set? Great! Here are the concepts from that course that you'll be needing as you make your Ionic application:

TODO

If you didn't understand the above at Code School or they didn't come up, have a Google for clarification.

Install Ionic and Make A Blank App

Get <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">Xcode</a> and Homebrew:

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

Then install npm with Homebrew:

brew install node

Now we can install Ionic globally with:

npm install -g cordova ionic

You will notice that we first install Cordova, and that is important. We need Cordova as it is on this that Ionic is built. In fact, the mobile plugin we are using is a Cordova plugin. More on that later.

Now we can generate a blank mobile application. We have three options: blank, tabs and sidemenu. We will use the third:

ionic start myApp sidemenu

You may be asked to open or login to an ionic.io account. This is entirely optional and not necessary for this tutorial.

Now remove/add iOS to your application (it probably got installed by default though), build your app and launch it in the browser:
cd myApp
ionic platform rm ios; ionic platform add ios
ionic build ios
ionic serve --lab

Alternatively, you can swap out that last command with:

ionic emulate ios

to see this in Apple's iOS emulator. The emulator is cool, but very very slow. You can marginally increase its startup screen by opening Xcode and selecting the Window > Devices menu. In the window that appears, remove the (many) devices you won't be testing on. Even with this hack, building and emulating mobile apps is time-consuming.

For this reason, I recommend using the browser for initial development. It has the added bonus of automatically refreshing when it detects any code is changed.

When serving in the browser, you may get errors for CORS security violations. This will not happen in the actual app, and is only due to the fact that you are serving the application in the browser. To stop these errors (and only during development as it is a security hazard!) you can launch Chrome this way to disable these security checks and allow you to preview how your app would run:

/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --disable-web-security --user-data-dir

NOTE Occasionally, at some point in this process, you may get an error that complains about the lack of some icon. This can be fixed by generating all icons with the following command:

ionic resources --icon

NOTE As you add plugins, you may find that you get inexplicable errors. One thing that can help: remove your iOS platform and reinstall it:

ionic platform rm ios; ionic platform add ios

Editing Your Application

Peering into our myApp folder reveals a lot of files you will not be worrying about. Open up www and find something more familiar - HTML, Angular and CSS. We are home!
